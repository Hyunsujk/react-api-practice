# React-api-practice

## Description

This repo is to practice api that I will need to use for my solo project for Prime Digital Academy.
In this readme, I will log what I've done to setup the application for future reference.

## Setup sequence

1. Created components/page files
2. installed dependencies
   `npm install axios body-parser express pg react-redux react-router-dom redux redux-logger redux-saga`
